## Background

[The cost of DNA sequencing has decreased dramatically since the end of 2007](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data).
This was the point at which sequencing efforts increasingly moved away from the [Sanger dye-terminator method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing), to a "next" generation of sequencing technologies, which are faster, cheaper and produce many more reads in parallel.
Despite their higher throughput, the reads are shorter and of lower quality than those produced by Sanger sequencing.

One next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has come to dominate: [Illumina sequencing by synthesis (SBS)](https://www.illumina.com/documents/products/techspotlights/techspotlight_sequencing.pdf) on Genome Analyzer, HiSeq, MiSeq, NextSeq and NovaSeq instruments.
This technology was developed by Cambridge scientists Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman in the Department of Chemistry, who formed a company called Solexa in 1998.
Illumina acquired Solexa in 2007.

This [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8) shows in detail how Illumina sequencing by synthesis works.
The method uses flow cells containing clusters of clonally amplified DNA fragments.
The underlying nucleotide sequence of each fragment is determined based on signal emitted by each cluster under laser excitation of a fluorescently labelled nucleotide that has been added to an extending sequence complementary to the fragment.
Millions or even billions of clusters per flow cell are sequenced simultaneously, during which for each cluster an image is captured for each successive base along the DNA fragment, with read length dependent on the method employed. 

Due in large part to this breakthrough technology, we have seen the cost of sequencing a single person’s genome drop from a prohibitive US$10 million in 2007 to ~US$1,000 by mid-2015!
There have been various refinements to Illumina’s technology, including the use of [patterned flow cells](https://emea.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/sequencing-technology/patterned-flow-cells.html) that have billions of ordered nanowells.
These patterned flow cells provide optimal "fixed" rather than random spacing between clusters of clonally amplified DNA fragments, for increased cluster density and simplified imaging.

A third generation of sequencing machines from [Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)](https://www.pacb.com/smrt-science/smrt-sequencing/) and [Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)](https://nanoporetech.com/how-it-works) have become available more recently, providing average read lengths of 10–18 kilobases.

A number of considerations come into play when deciding on what kind of sequencing technology to use for a project.
Cost and time requirements differ between technologies.
For example, the costs associated with using newer technology to generate long sequencing reads might not be justifiable or efficient for the intended application.
Some applications require high sequencing depth of coverage of specific parts of the genome (i.e., large numbers of reads overlapping those genomic positions; e.g., identification of protein binding sites using [ChIP-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP_sequencing), or gene expression profiling via [RNA-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq)).
Others require greater breadth of coverage of the genome, such as projects aimed at assembling genomes or genomic regions from scratch, termed [*de novo* assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_sequence_assemblers).
Therefore, the different sequencing read lengths, qualities, abundances and error rates that are associated with different technologies need to be taken into account in order to make the right choice.

This practical aims to familiarise you with Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and some of the command-line software tools available for their analysis.
Command-line tools are central to most bioinformatics pipelines as they enable efficient, flexible, automated and reproducible data processing and analysis.
Linux operating systems are preferred for running bioinformatics analyses, as most of the command-line tools available for these analyses have been developed primarily for these systems (we are using the Ubuntu Linux distribution today).

Don't worry if you have little or no experience with using a command-line interface, as we'll start with some straightforward commands so that you feel comfortable navigating around the file system using this interface rather than a graphical user interface (GUI).
And of course, please feel free to ask any questions about this aspect during the practical.
Additionally, this [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/) should help to familiarise you with some commonly used commands.

## The data

The NGS data we are going to analyse are derived from whole-genome sequencing of the Landsberg *erecta* (L*er*) [ecotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotype) of the [diploid](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Diploid) model plant species [*Arabidopsis thaliana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana), and were published in [Zapata et al. (2016) *PNAS* **113**](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/28/E4052).

The data are [paired-end reads](https://emea.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/plan-experiments/paired-end-vs-single-read.html) and so there are two files: `SRR3166543_top1M_1.fastq.gz` contains the first read in each pair and `SRR3166543_top1M_2.fastq.gz` the second.
Each read in a pair was sequenced with 100 chemistry cycles on an [Illumina HiSeq 2000](https://www.illumina.com/documents/products/datasheets/datasheet_hiseq2000.pdf), generating 100 consecutive base calls per read (2×100 bp).

The reads were downloaded from the the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR3166543), which "provides a comprehensive record of the world's nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation".
The top 1 million reads (`top1M`) in each of the two files were extracted in order to reduce time spent on data processing in today's practical.

* * *

## The pipeline

Bioinformatics pipelines or workflows consist of sequential data processing and analysis steps that utilise different software tools, with the output file(s) from one step often serving as the input file(s) for the subsequent step(s).
These pipelines require input files that conform to standardised formats for storing different types of genomics data.

The goal of our pipeline is to identify DNA sequence differences (variants) in the genome of the L*er* ecotype of *A. thaliana* relative to the reference genome assembly for the Columbia (Col-0) ecotype.
To this end, these are the steps in the pipeline that we will work through sequentially:

1. Evaluation of sequencing read quality, including at the level of individual bases
2. Removal of technical sequences (e.g., sequencing adapters) and low-quality bases
3. Alignment of reads (from L*er*) to a reference sequence (for Col-0)
4. Filtering of alignments based on the quality of these mappings to the reference genome
5. Detection of DNA sequence differences between the L*er* and Col-0 genomes (variant calling)

Variant calling is often an important part of genetic mapping studies aimed at dissecting the genetic basis of particular traits or conditions, and of research into genetic variation within populations.
Bioinformatics pipelines that work with other types of NGS data (such as RNA-seq or ChIP-seq) apply the first four of the steps above.
This practical should therefore give you a general feel for how NGS data processing and analysis pipelines work.

## Inspecting the reads in FASTQ format

On your desktop, you should see a shortcut to a command-line terminal (a black square with a dollar symbol followed by an underscore) towards the bottom of the screen.
This provides a command-line interface for interacting with and navigating around the file system of the computer, as opposed to a graphical user interface (GUI).
On opening this terminal window, you should see that your current working directory (folder) is `~/Course_Materials` (the tilde symbol, `~`, is shorthand for your home directory).
This is followed by the command prompt (`$` and then a rectangular cursor) where you can type text to issue commands that the computer will execute.

Run this command to see the absolute (full) path to your current working directory printed to the terminal window:

```
pwd
```

### Output:
```
/home/participant/Course_Materials
```

This is a useful command to run every now and again to check exactly where you're working in the directory structure, because often you'll expect to find particular files in subdirectories of your current working directory.

Run `ls` to list the contents of your current working directory.
Navigate into the `fastq/` and `genome/` subdirectories of `Course_Materials/` using `cd` (<ins>c</ins>hange <ins>d</ins>irectory) and `cd ..` commands (the latter of which navigates one directory up in the directory structure), and list their contents using `ls`.
This process of navigating around the directory structure has involved issuing `cd` commands followed by *relative paths*.
It's also possible and sometimes more appropriate to navigate to particular locations in the directory structure using *absolute paths*:

```
cd /home/participant/Course_Materials/
```

The sequencing reads are contained in gzip-compressed [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) files, a standardised format that NGS data analysis tools have been developed to handle.
These files are available on the Linux computers we are using today, so there's no need to download them.
The files are located in `/home/participant/Course_Materials/fastq/`.

Data in FASTQ format conform to these standards:

| Line | Description |
|--:|:--|
| 1 | Begins with '@', followed by information about the read
| 2 | The DNA sequence
| 3 | Begins with '+'
| 4 | A character string of the same length as the sequence, encoding quality scores for each base

Let's have a look at one of the gzip-compressed FASTQ files to inspect its format.

Use `zcat` and `head` to print the first eight lines of `SRR3166543_top1M_1.fastq.gz` to the terminal window.
This printed output is called standard output (stdout), and can be redirected to a file by appending ` > filename.txt` to the command.
We need to use `zcat` here to uncompress the gzip-compressed file.
The `cat` command prints the contents of already uncompressed files, or con<ins>cat</ins>enates and prints the contents of multiple already uncompressed files. 
The `|` part of the command below "pipes" the output of the `zcat` command to the `head` command, which prints the top `-n #` lines of piped input (`fastq/SRR3166543_top1M_1.fastq.gz`).

```
zcat fastq/SRR3166543_top1M_1.fastq.gz | head -n 8
```

### Output:
```
@SRR3166543.1 1/1

+
#0;@################################################################################################
```

The first four lines show data for one read and the next four lines show data for the subsequent read, each corresponding to the first read in a pair of reads.
The second read in each pair is contained in `SRR3166543_top1M_2.fastq.gz`.
The first line for each read contains a unique identifier and, as these are paired-end reads, `/1` indicates that this is the first read in the pair.

The quality score of each base identified in a sequencing read is encoded as a single character on the fourth line.
These represent [Phred quality scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score) that have been [converted into ASCII\_BASE=33 characters](https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/quality_score.html), such that each character encodes a quality score for the corresponding base in the read.
That is, each character in the string is the ASCII encoding of the Phred-scaled base quality score+33.

A Phred quality score is logarithmically related to the probability of an incorrect base call *P*, expressed as 1 error in 10<sup>*Q*/10</sup> base calls of *Q* quality, or

> *Q* = -10 × log<sub>10</sub>(*P*)  
> *P* = 10<sup>-*Q*/10</sup>  

Accordingly, the ASCII\_BASE=33 character `@` (decimal representation = 64) encodes a *Q*-score of 31 (31 + 33 = 64) and a base-calling error probability of 0.00079 (= 10<sup>\-31/10</sup>).
In the past, Illumina sequencing instruments used the [ASCII\_BASE=64 quality encoding](https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/quality_score.html).

Is the first read composed of mostly high-quality or low-quality base calls?

### Exercise 1

Construct a command that will print the 1000th read in `SRR3166543_top1M_1.fastq.gz` in order to inspect its quality.

**Question:** Is the 1000th read generally better or worse than the first read?

  **Answer:** It's better than the first read, although there are some low-quality "N"s.

## Step 1. Evaluating read quality using FastQC

Read quality can be evaluated in a more systematic way using dedicated software, such as [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
Make sure FastQC is installed by invoking the executable file `fastqc` with an option that will report the version.

```
fastqc --version
```

### Output (abbreviated):
```
FastQC v0.11.9
```

The `--version` and `--help` options are available for most tools.
The latter generally shows an example of typical usage of the executable file with arguments, along with a list of options for the program.
"Piping" the output into the `less` command using `|` allows you to scroll through the output with the `up` and `down` keys.
Type `q` to quit the `less` program when you've finished inspecting the output.

```
fastqc --help | less
```

### Output:
```

            FastQC - A high throughput sequence QC analysis tool

SYNOPSIS

	fastqc seqfile1 seqfile2 .. seqfileN

    fastqc [-o output dir] [--(no)extract] [-f fastq|bam|sam] 
           [-c contaminant file] seqfile1 .. seqfileN

DESCRIPTION

    FastQC reads a set of sequence files and produces from each one a quality
    control report consisting of a number of different modules, each one of 
    which will help to identify a different potential type of problem in your
    data.
    
    If no files to process are specified on the command line then the program
    will start as an interactive graphical application.  If files are provided
    on the command line then the program will run with no user interaction
    required.  In this mode it is suitable for inclusion into a standardised
    analysis pipeline.
    
    The options for the program as as follows:
    
    -h --help       Print this help file and exit
    
    -v --version    Print the version of the program and exit
    
    -o --outdir     Create all output files in the specified output directory.
                    Please note that this directory must exist as the program
                    will not create it.  If this option is not set then the 
                    output file for each sequence file is created in the same
                    directory as the sequence file which was processed.
                    
    --casava        Files come from raw casava output. Files in the same sample
                    group (differing only by the group number) will be analysed
                    as a set rather than individually. Sequences with the filter
                    flag set in the header will be excluded from the analysis.
                    Files must have the same names given to them by casava
                    (including being gzipped and ending with .gz) otherwise they
                    won't be grouped together correctly.
                    
    --nano          Files come from nanopore sequences and are in fast5 format. In
                    this mode you can pass in directories to process and the program
                    will take in all fast5 files within those directories and produce
                    a single output file from the sequences found in all files.                    
                    
    --nofilter      If running with --casava then don't remove read flagged by
                    casava as poor quality when performing the QC analysis.
                   
    --extract       If set then the zipped output file will be uncompressed in
                    the same directory after it has been created.  By default
                    this option will be set if fastqc is run in non-interactive
                    mode.
                    
    -j --java       Provides the full path to the java binary you want to use to
                    launch fastqc. If not supplied then java is assumed to be in
                    your path.
                   
    --noextract     Do not uncompress the output file after creating it.  You
                    should set this option if you do not wish to uncompress
                    the output when running in non-interactive mode.
                    
    --nogroup       Disable grouping of bases for reads >50bp. All reports will
                    show data for every base in the read.  WARNING: Using this
                    option will cause fastqc to crash and burn if you use it on
                    really long reads, and your plots may end up a ridiculous size.
                    You have been warned!
                    
    --min_length    Sets an artificial lower limit on the length of the sequence
                    to be shown in the report.  As long as you set this to a value
                    greater or equal to your longest read length then this will be
                    the sequence length used to create your read groups.  This can
                    be useful for making directly comaparable statistics from 
                    datasets with somewhat variable read lengths.
                    
    -f --format     Bypasses the normal sequence file format detection and
                    forces the program to use the specified format.  Valid
                    formats are bam,sam,bam_mapped,sam_mapped and fastq
                    
    -t --threads    Specifies the number of files which can be processed
                    simultaneously.  Each thread will be allocated 250MB of
                    memory so you shouldn't run more threads than your
                    available memory will cope with, and not more than
                    6 threads on a 32 bit machine
                  
    -c              Specifies a non-default file which contains the list of
    --contaminants  contaminants to screen overrepresented sequences against.
                    The file must contain sets of named contaminants in the
                    form name[tab]sequence.  Lines prefixed with a hash will
                    be ignored.

    -a              Specifies a non-default file which contains the list of
    --adapters      adapter sequences which will be explicity searched against
                    the library. The file must contain sets of named adapters
                    in the form name[tab]sequence.  Lines prefixed with a hash
                    will be ignored.
                    
    -l              Specifies a non-default file which contains a set of criteria
    --limits        which will be used to determine the warn/error limits for the
                    various modules.  This file can also be used to selectively 
                    remove some modules from the output all together.  The format
                    needs to mirror the default limits.txt file found in the
                    Configuration folder.
                    
   -k --kmers       Specifies the length of Kmer to look for in the Kmer content
                    module. Specified Kmer length must be between 2 and 10. Default
                    length is 7 if not specified.
                    
   -q --quiet       Supress all progress messages on stdout and only report errors.
   
   -d --dir         Selects a directory to be used for temporary files written when
                    generating report images. Defaults to system temp directory if
                    not specified.
                    
BUGS

    Any bugs in fastqc should be reported either to simon.andrews@babraham.ac.uk
    or in www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/bugzilla/
                   
    
```

In the output printed above, you will see the `--outdir` option, which allows you to specify an output directory to which the FastQC results will be written.
However, this directory must exist before running FastQC, so we'd better make it if we want to use this option.
The `-p` option in the `mkdir` command below allows us to make a new directory containing subdirectories.

```
mkdir -p results/fastqc/raw_reads
```

Now run FastQC on each of the two gzip-compressed FASTQ files located in the `fastq/` directory by using the `*.fastq.gz` wildcard.
Compressed or uncompressed files can be provided as inputs.

```
fastqc --outdir results/fastqc/raw_reads \
       fastq/*.fastq.gz
```

Progress made by FastQC on analysing each file will be sent to stdout and therefore printed to the terminal window.

### Exercise 2

Have a look at the FastQC-generated HTML file for each FASTQ file by opening them in a web browser.

```
firefox SRR3166543_top1M_1_fastqc.html SRR3166543_top1M_2_fastqc.html
```

**Question:** What quality issues can you see in these reports, and how could they be fixed?

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Solution</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  **Answer:** They are generally high-quality sequencing reads. However, there are some issues that should be addressed:
  1. Per-base sequence quality decreases towards the ends of the reads (particularly towards their 3′ ends)
  2. There are some duplicated reads, which may have resulted from [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction) amplification biases
  
  The first issue can be resolved using software developed to trim off low-quality bases and sequencing adapters.
  Duplication can be addressed by discarding either duplicate reads or duplicate alignments to a reference genome.
</p></details>

If in future you are working with many FASTQ files, [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) can be used to aggregate FastQC-generated results and compile one HTML report that's easier to digest than individual reports for each sample.

## Step 2. Removing technical sequences and low-quality bases using Cutadapt

There are several tools available for filtering and trimming reads to remove technical sequences (e.g., sequencing adapters) and low-quality bases, including [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic).
Removing these sequences is important because it means that subsequent analyses won't be compromised by base calls in which we have low confidence, or by the presence of technical sequences that do not reflect the biology of the sample we have sequenced.
In the case of aligning reads to a reference genome assembly, for example, read cleaning tends to increase the alignment rate.

We're going to use Cutadapt for this step in the pipeline, so have a look at a usage example and the available options.
Type `q` to quit the `less` program when you've finished inspecting the output.

```
cutadapt --help | less
```

### Output:
```
cutadapt version 3.5

Copyright (C) 2010-2021 Marcel Martin <marcel.martin@scilifelab.se>

cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads.

Usage:
    cutadapt -a ADAPTER [options] [-o output.fastq] input.fastq

For paired-end reads:
    cutadapt -a ADAPT1 -A ADAPT2 [options] -o out1.fastq -p out2.fastq in1.fastq in2.fastq

Replace "ADAPTER" with the actual sequence of your 3' adapter. IUPAC wildcard
characters are supported. All reads from input.fastq will be written to
output.fastq with the adapter sequence removed. Adapter matching is
error-tolerant. Multiple adapter sequences can be given (use further -a
options), but only the best-matching adapter will be removed.

Input may also be in FASTA format. Compressed input and output is supported and
auto-detected from the file name (.gz, .xz, .bz2). Use the file name '-' for
standard input/output. Without the -o option, output is sent to standard output.

Run "cutadapt --help" to see all command-line options.
See https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/ for full documentation.

Options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  --version             Show version number and exit
  --debug [{trace}]     Print debug log. 'trace' prints also DP matrices
  -j CORES, --cores CORES
                        Number of CPU cores to use. Use 0 to auto-detect. Default: 1

Finding adapters:
  Parameters -a, -g, -b specify adapters to be removed from each read (or from the first read in a pair if data is paired).
  If specified multiple times, only the best matching adapter is trimmed (but see the --times option). When the special
  notation 'file:FILE' is used, adapter sequences are read from the given FASTA file.

  -a ADAPTER, --adapter ADAPTER
                        Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 3' end (paired data: of the first read). The adapter and
                        subsequent bases are trimmed. If a '$' character is appended ('anchoring'), the adapter is only found
                        if it is a suffix of the read.
  -g ADAPTER, --front ADAPTER
                        Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 5' end (paired data: of the first read). The adapter and any
                        preceding bases are trimmed. Partial matches at the 5' end are allowed. If a '^' character is prepended
                        ('anchoring'), the adapter is only found if it is a prefix of the read.
  -b ADAPTER, --anywhere ADAPTER
                        Sequence of an adapter that may be ligated to the 5' or 3' end (paired data: of the first read). Both
                        types of matches as described under -a und -g are allowed. If the first base of the read is part of the
                        match, the behavior is as with -g, otherwise as with -a. This option is mostly for rescuing failed
                        library preparations - do not use if you know which end your adapter was ligated to!
  -e RATE, --error-rate RATE
                        Maximum allowed error rate as value between 0 and 1 (no. of errors divided by length of matching
                        region). Default: 0.1 (=10%)
  --no-indels           Allow only mismatches in alignments. Default: allow both mismatches and indels
  -n COUNT, --times COUNT
                        Remove up to COUNT adapters from each read. Default: 1
  -O MINLENGTH, --overlap MINLENGTH
                        Require MINLENGTH overlap between read and adapter for an adapter to be found. Default: 3
  --match-read-wildcards
                        Interpret IUPAC wildcards in reads. Default: False
  -N, --no-match-adapter-wildcards
                        Do not interpret IUPAC wildcards in adapters.
  --action {trim,mask,lowercase,none}
                        What to do with found adapters. mask: replace with 'N' characters; lowercase: convert to lowercase;
                        none: leave unchanged (useful with --discard-untrimmed). Default: trim
  --rc, --revcomp       Check both the read and its reverse complement for adapter matches. If match is on reverse-complemented
                        version, output that one. Default: check only read

Additional read modifications:
  -u LENGTH, --cut LENGTH
                        Remove bases from each read (first read only if paired). If LENGTH is positive, remove bases from the
                        beginning. If LENGTH is negative, remove bases from the end. Can be used twice if LENGTHs have
                        different signs. This is applied *before* adapter trimming.
  --nextseq-trim 3'CUTOFF
                        NextSeq-specific quality trimming (each read). Trims also dark cycles appearing as high-quality G
                        bases.
  -q [5'CUTOFF,]3'CUTOFF, --quality-cutoff [5'CUTOFF,]3'CUTOFF
                        Trim low-quality bases from 5' and/or 3' ends of each read before adapter removal. Applied to both
                        reads if data is paired. If one value is given, only the 3' end is trimmed. If two comma-separated
                        cutoffs are given, the 5' end is trimmed with the first cutoff, the 3' end with the second.
  --quality-base N      Assume that quality values in FASTQ are encoded as ascii(quality + N). This needs to be set to 64 for
                        some old Illumina FASTQ files. Default: 33
  --length LENGTH, -l LENGTH
                        Shorten reads to LENGTH. Positive values remove bases at the end while negative ones remove bases at
                        the beginning. This and the following modifications are applied after adapter trimming.
  --trim-n              Trim N's on ends of reads.
  --length-tag TAG      Search for TAG followed by a decimal number in the description field of the read. Replace the decimal
                        number with the correct length of the trimmed read. For example, use --length-tag 'length=' to correct
                        fields like 'length=123'.
  --strip-suffix STRIP_SUFFIX
                        Remove this suffix from read names if present. Can be given multiple times.
  -x PREFIX, --prefix PREFIX
                        Add this prefix to read names. Use {name} to insert the name of the matching adapter.
  -y SUFFIX, --suffix SUFFIX
                        Add this suffix to read names; can also include {name}
  --zero-cap, -z        Change negative quality values to zero.

Filtering of processed reads:
  Filters are applied after above read modifications. Paired-end reads are always discarded pairwise (see also --pair-
  filter).

  -m LEN[:LEN2], --minimum-length LEN[:LEN2]
                        Discard reads shorter than LEN. Default: 0
  -M LEN[:LEN2], --maximum-length LEN[:LEN2]
                        Discard reads longer than LEN. Default: no limit
  --max-n COUNT         Discard reads with more than COUNT 'N' bases. If COUNT is a number between 0 and 1, it is interpreted
                        as a fraction of the read length.
  --max-expected-errors ERRORS, --max-ee ERRORS
                        Discard reads whose expected number of errors (computed from quality values) exceeds ERRORS.
  --discard-trimmed, --discard
                        Discard reads that contain an adapter. Use also -O to avoid discarding too many randomly matching
                        reads.
  --discard-untrimmed, --trimmed-only
                        Discard reads that do not contain an adapter.
  --discard-casava      Discard reads that did not pass CASAVA filtering (header has :Y:).

Output:
  --quiet               Print only error messages.
  --report {full,minimal}
                        Which type of report to print: 'full' or 'minimal'. Default: full
  -o FILE, --output FILE
                        Write trimmed reads to FILE. FASTQ or FASTA format is chosen depending on input. Summary report is sent
                        to standard output. Use '{name}' for demultiplexing (see docs). Default: write to standard output
  --fasta               Output FASTA to standard output even on FASTQ input.
  -Z                    Use compression level 1 for gzipped output files (faster, but uses more space)
  --info-file FILE      Write information about each read and its adapter matches into FILE. See the documentation for the file
                        format.
  -r FILE, --rest-file FILE
                        When the adapter matches in the middle of a read, write the rest (after the adapter) to FILE.
  --wildcard-file FILE  When the adapter has N wildcard bases, write adapter bases matching wildcard positions to FILE.
                        (Inaccurate with indels.)
  --too-short-output FILE
                        Write reads that are too short (according to length specified by -m) to FILE. Default: discard reads
  --too-long-output FILE
                        Write reads that are too long (according to length specified by -M) to FILE. Default: discard reads
  --untrimmed-output FILE
                        Write reads that do not contain any adapter to FILE. Default: output to same file as trimmed reads

Paired-end options:
  The -A/-G/-B/-U options work like their -a/-b/-g/-u counterparts, but are applied to the second read in each pair.

  -A ADAPTER            3' adapter to be removed from second read in a pair.
  -G ADAPTER            5' adapter to be removed from second read in a pair.
  -B ADAPTER            5'/3 adapter to be removed from second read in a pair.
  -U LENGTH             Remove LENGTH bases from second read in a pair.
  -p FILE, --paired-output FILE
                        Write second read in a pair to FILE.
  --pair-adapters       Treat adapters given with -a/-A etc. as pairs. Either both or none are removed from each read pair.
  --pair-filter (any|both|first)
                        Which of the reads in a paired-end read have to match the filtering criterion in order for the pair to
                        be filtered. Default: any
  --interleaved         Read and/or write interleaved paired-end reads.
  --untrimmed-paired-output FILE
                        Write second read in a pair to this FILE when no adapter was found. Use with --untrimmed-output.
                        Default: output to same file as trimmed reads
  --too-short-paired-output FILE
                        Write second read in a pair to this file if pair is too short. Use also --too-short-output.
  --too-long-paired-output FILE
                        Write second read in a pair to this file if pair is too long. Use also --too-long-output.
```

In the Cutadapt `--help` output printed above, we can see that the `-a` and `-A` options are used to specify the adapter sequences to be trimmed from the 3’ ends of Read 1 and Read 2 sequences, respectively.
An Illumina TruSeq DNA library preparation kit was used to generate the paired-end sequencing reads we are analysing.
Therefore, we need to consult the [Illumina Adapter Sequences Document](https://emea.support.illumina.com/downloads/illumina-adapter-sequences-document-1000000002694.html?langsel=/gb/) to locate the correct adapter information for inclusion in our Cutadapt command.
For most Illumina read types, including those derived from TruSeq libraries, [adapter trimming is required only at read 3’ ends](https://emea.support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/04/adapter-trimming-why-are-adapter-sequences-trimmed-from-only-the--ends-of-reads.html).

We should first make a subdirectory that will contain the Cutadapt-cleaned reads.

```
pwd
ls
cd ../../../
pwd
ls
mkdir results/cutadapt/
```

### Exercise 3

Based on the usage example and options shown in the output printed above, or consulting the [Cutadapt user guide](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#), write a Cutadapt command that will remove:
1. bases with Phred quality scores < 20 ([ASCII_BASE=33](https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/quality_score.html)) at the 3’ end of each read, as we have observed in the FastQC reports that base quality tends to degrade towards the 3’ ends of these reads, which is a general feature of Illumina reads
2. sequences that match a minimum of 4 consecutive bases in Illumina TruSeq adapters (Cutadapt will also remove any bases following [3’ of] a read–adapter match)
3. reads shorted than 30 bases, which will improve alignment performance, as the shorter the sequence, the greater the chance that it will align to multiple locations in a reference genome

Cutadapt will send a report of progress and trimming statistics to standard output (stdout), which will be visible in your terminal window, in the same way FastQC printed its progress to the terminal window.
Try to find a way to redirect the stdout and stderr (error messages, if any) generated by your `cutadapt` command to an appropriately named log file, which will be useful for future reference.

**Question:** What proportion of read pairs and base calls passed the filters?

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Hint</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  You'll need to include the following options in your command:
  `-a`, `-A`, `--quality-cutoff`, `--overlap`, `--minimum-length`, `--output`, `--paired-output`

  To make long commands more intelligible, I tend to write them over multiple lines by appending ` \` to the end of each line, and indenting lines after the first. 

  To redirect stdout and stderr:
  ```
  (executableFile --option1 this \
                  --option2 that \
                  --output outFile \
                  inFile) \
  &> uniquely_named_report.log
  ```
</p></details>

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Solution</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  ```
  (cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA \
            -A AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT \
            --quality-cutoff 20 \
            --overlap 4 \
            --minimum-length 30 \
            --output results/cutadapt/SRR3166543_top1M_1_trimmed.fastq.gz \
            --paired-output results/cutadapt/SRR3166543_top1M_2_trimmed.fastq.gz \
            fastq/SRR3166543_top1M_1.fastq.gz \
            fastq/SRR3166543_top1M_2.fastq.gz) \
  &> results/cutadapt/SRR3166543_top1M_cutadapt_report.log
  ```

  **Answer:** 97% of read pairs and 95.9% of base calls remain after cleaning.
</p></details>

We can now use FastQC to evaluate the quality of the Cutadapt-trimmed reads, so make an output directory to contain the FastQC results.

```
mkdir results/fastqc/trimmed_reads
```

### Exercise 4

Write and run a `fastqc` command to evaluate the cleaned reads, specifying the newly created output directory for the FastQC results.
Once this has run to completion, inspect the FastQC-generated HTML reports to see if the cleaning step improved the reads.

**Question:** Is any further read cleaning required?

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Solution</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  ```
  fastqc --outdir results/fastqc/trimmed_reads \
         results/cutadapt/*.fastq.gz
  ```
  
  **Answer:** The quality of the reads has improved after cleaning with Cutadapt, but there are some issues.
  
  The [Sequence length distribution](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/7%20Sequence%20Length%20Distribution.html) warning can also be ignored as we expect variable-length sequences after trimming.
  
  Sequence duplication can be addressed by discarding either duplicate reads or duplicate alignments to a reference genome.
  We will use the latter approach.

## Step 3. Aligning the cleaned reads to a reference genome assembly

Now we have removed adapters and low-quality bases from the sequencing reads, we can proceed with the next step in the pipeline: alignment of these cleaned read pairs from the Landsberg *erecta* (L*er*) ecotype to a reference genome assembly for the Columia (Col-0) ecotype.
These two [ecotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotype) are genetically distinct true-breeding lines within the diploid plant species *Arabidopsis thaliana*.
Therefore, while they are genetically different from one another, they are each homozygous at most loci (positions) on each chromosome.

Reference genome assemblies are stored in [FASTA format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format), with one of the following file extensions: `.fa`, `.fas` or `.fasta`.
For species with chromosome-level assemblies, each chromosome is represented as a separate nucleotide sequence in the FASTA file.
The first line of each separate sequence in the FASTA file is a description line, beginning with a greater-than symbol followed by a name or unique identifier for the sequence (e.g., `>Chr1`) and optional additional information.
The nucleotide sequence is wrapped over the subsequent lines up until the next distinct sequence description line.

The reference genome assembly for *Arabidopsis thaliana* (`TAIR10_chr_all.fa`) is located in `/home/participant/Course_Materials/genome/`.
This was previously downloaded from [The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)](https://www.arabidopsis.org/download/index-auto.jsp?dir=%2Fdownload_files%2FGenes%2FTAIR10_genome_release%2FTAIR10_chromosome_files), so there's no need to download it for this practical.

### Exercise 5

Run a command that will output the description line of each separate DNA sequence in `genome/TAIR10_chr_all.fa`.

**Question:** How many distinct sequences corresponding to nuclear chromosomes and non-nuclear DNA-containing organelles are there?

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Hint</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  A command-line tool that could be used for this is `grep` (short for global regular expression print), combined with a character in speech marks that you know to be present in all sequence description lines of the FASTA file (each begins with `>`).
</p></details>

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Solution</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  ```

## Alignment using Bowtie 2

To align the cleaned read pairs (`SRR3166543_top1M_1_trimmed.fastq.gz` and `SRR3166543_top1M_2_trimmed.fastq.gz`) to the reference genome, we're going to use [Bowtie 2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml), a fast and memory-efficient tool that indexes the reference genome based on the [Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform).
From [Li and Durbin (2009) *Bioinformatics* **25**](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324):
> "Essentially, using backward search [...] with BWT, we are able to effectively mimic the top-down traversal on the prefix trie of the genome with relatively small memory footprint [...] and to count the number of exact hits of a string of length *m* in *O*(*m*) time independent of the size of the genome."  

Other programs for aligning short (NGS) reads to large reference sequences include [BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa), [HISAT2](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/) and [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR).
[minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) was developed primarily for aligning long-read data (e.g., PacBio or Oxford Nanopore reads) to large reference sequences. 
Alignment to a reference genome requires index files specific to the alignment software being used.

**You don't need to generate these index files in this case, as they have already been created in the `genome/` directory (using a `bowtie2-build` command) to save time.**

As we already have the genome index files, have a look at the Bowtie 2 `--help` output for information about example usage and options.
Type `q` to quit the `less` program when you've finished inspecting the output.

```
bowtie2 --help | less
```

```

Make a directory to contain the output file of read alignments that Bowtie 2 will generate.

```
mkdir results/bowtie2
```

### Exercise 6

Based on the usage example shown in the output printed above and the [Bowtie 2 manual](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml), write and run a `bowtie2` command that:
1. uses the least sensitive (fastest) preset option for end-to-end read alignment
2. prevents Bowtie 2 from attempting to find alignments for the individual mates in a read pair
3. prevents Bowtie 2 from attempting to find alignments that do not satisfy the paired-end constraints
4. specifies the reference genome filename prefix (without the `.X.bt2` suffix/extension)
5. specifies the two gzip-compressed FASTQ files containing trimmed read pairs
6. writes alignments to a file in SAM (<ins>S</ins>equence <ins>A</ins>lignment/<ins>M</ins>ap) format, with a `.sam` file extension, in the output directory

Redirect the stdout and stderr generated by your `bowtie2` command to an appropriately named log file, which will be useful for future reference.

**Questions:** What proportion of read pairs aligned "concordantly" (i.e., in a manner that satisfies their paired-end constraints) to only one location in the genome (so-called "unique" alignments)?
What proportion aligned to multiple genomic locations ("multiple" alignments)?

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Hint</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  You'll need to include the following options in your command:
  `--very-fast`, `--no-mixed`, `--no-discordant`, `-x`, `-1`, `-2`, `-S`
</p></details>

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Solution</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  ```
  (bowtie2 --very-fast \
           --no-mixed \
           --no-discordant \
           -x genome/TAIR10_chr_all \
           -1 results/cutadapt/SRR3166543_top1M_1_trimmed.fastq.gz \
           -2 results/cutadapt/SRR3166543_top1M_2_trimmed.fastq.gz \
           -S results/bowtie2/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all.sam) \
  &> results/bowtie2/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_report.log 
  ```

  **Answer:** 61.03% of read pairs aligned concordantly to only one genomic location.
  25.86% aligned concordantly to multiple genomic locations.
  86.88% overall alignment rate.

  Note that for a real analysis where time isn't limiting, it's advisable to use the most sensitive (slowest) preset option for end-to-end read alignment (`--very-sensitive`).
</p></details>

We should now have an output file containing alignments in [Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf).
Print to stdout the first 6 lines of the "alignment section" of the SAM file using [SAMtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) (by default, `samtools view` doesn't output the SAM "header section").

```
samtools view results/bowtie2/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all.sam | head -n 6
```

```

The alignment section of the SAM output file has one line per read and, where applicable, unsorted alignments for paired reads are output on consecutive lines.
Each alignment line has a minimum of 11 tab-separated fields, with a variable number of optional fields.
From left to right, the 11 mandatory fields are:

1. Name of read that aligned.

2. Sum of all applicable [bitwise flags](https://biowize.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/decoding-sam-flags/). There are 11 possible flags with decimal encodings:
     
    | Flag | Description |
    |--:|:--|
    | 1    | The read is one of a pair
    | 2    | The alignment is one end of a proper ("concordant") paired-end alignment
    | 4    | The read has no reported alignments
    | 8    | The read is one of a pair of reads in which the other read has no reported alignments
    | 16   | The alignment is to the reverse strand of the reference sequence
    | 32   | The other read in the paired-end alignment is aligned to the reverse strand of the reference sequence
    | 64   | The read is the first mate in a pair
    | 128  | The read is the second mate in a pair
    | 256  | Secondary alignment
    | 512  | The read failed filters (e.g., sequencing platform quality controls)
    | 1024 | PCR or optical duplicate
    | 2048 | Supplementary alignment
     
    For example, a read that is the first mate in a pair, and aligns to the reverse strand of the reference sequence, as part of a proper paired-end alignment will have flag 83 (= 64 + 16 + 2 + 1).
     
    This is a useful [tool for decoding SAM flags](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html), and can be used to inform subsequent filtering of the alignments.
     
3. Name of reference sequence where alignment occurs, or ordinal ID if no name was provided.

4. 1-based offset into the forward strand of the reference sequence where the leftmost character of the alignment occurs.

5. Mapping quality (MAPQ). [A Bowtie 2-assigned MAPQ of 42 is reserved for reads that align to only one genomic location](http://biofinysics.blogspot.com/2014/05/how-does-bowtie2-assign-mapq-scores.html).

6. CIGAR string representation of alignment.

7. Name of reference sequence where mate's primary alignment occurs. Set to = if the mate's reference sequence is the same as this alignment's, or * if there is no mate.

8. 1-based offset into the forward strand of the reference sequence where the leftmost character of the mate's alignment occurs. Offset is 0 if there is no mate.

9. Inferred insert size. Size is negative if the mate's alignment occurs upstream of this alignment.  Size is 0 if there is no mate.

10. Read sequence (reverse-complemented if aligned to the reverse strand).

11. ASCII character encoding of Phred-scaled base qualities+33 (reverse-complemented if the read aligned to the reverse strand), similar to those in FASTQ format.

For further details on SAM mandatory and optional fields, see the [Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf).

How many paired-end alignments are there?

```
samtools view results/bowtie2/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all.sam \
              | cut -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

### Output:
```
970455
```

* * *

## Step 4. Filtering and sorting alignments using SAMtools

Now that we have obtained read alignments in SAM format, it's necessary to use [SAMtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) to filter out duplicate and ambiguous alignments, which could leave us with unreliable genotype information for Landsberg *erecta* (L*er*) at given genomic coordinates.

Make an output directory to contain the filtered alignments.

```
pwd
ls
mkdir results/samtools
```

### Step 4.1. Removing duplicate alignments

To remove duplicates alignments, we need to:
1. sort alignments by read name, using [`samtools sort -n`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-sort.html)
2. add mate-score tags with [`samtools fixmate -m`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-fixmate.html), which are used by `samtools markdup` to retain the best reads among duplicate alignments
3. sort alignments by coordinate within the reference sequence using [`samtools sort`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-sort.html) (required by `samtools markdup`), and finally
4. remove duplicate alignments using [`samtools markdup -r`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-markdup.html)

```
(samtools sort -n results/bowtie2/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all.sam \
| samtools fixmate -m -O sam - - \
| samtools sort - \
| samtools markdup -r -s \
                   -f results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup.stats \
                   -  results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup.bam) \
&> results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_report.log
```

In the commands above, you'll notice the inclusion of multiple instances of ` - `, which serve as filename placeholders for standard input (stdin) or standard output (stdout).
This allows us to pipe (`|`) stdout from one command to stdin for the subsequent command, obviating the need to write the output of each command to a file.
This is useful here because we're only interested in obtaining the output from `samtools markdup -r`.
 
Run a `less` or `cat` command on the "stats" file generated by `samtools markdup -r` (`results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup.stats`) to see how many paired-end alignments remain after removing duplicates.

### Output:
```

DUPLICATE NON PRIMARY OPTICAL: 0

ESTIMATED_LIBRARY_SIZE: 45877935
```

Another way to obtain this number is:

```
samtools view results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup.bam \
              | cut -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

### Output:
```
962754
```

Therefore, 7,701 duplicate paired-end alignments were removed by `samtools markdup -r`. 

This [blog post](http://core-genomics.blogspot.com/2016/05/increased-read-duplication-on-patterned.html) provides more details on the nature of different types of duplicate reads/alignments.

### Step 4.2. Removing ambiguous alignments

### Exercise 7

Consulting the [SAMtools manual](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-view.html) and this [tool for decoding SAM flags](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html), run a [`samtools view`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-view.html) command that will:
1. include the SAM header section
2. retain reads that each align as part of a proper ("concordant") paired-end alignment
3. remove any unmapped reads
4. retain alignments with a Bowtie 2-assigned mapping quality (MAPQ) score of 42, [which is assigned to uniquely aligned reads only](http://biofinysics.blogspot.com/2014/05/how-does-bowtie2-assign-mapq-scores.html)
5. output the retained alignments to a file in [Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) (a compressed version of SAM format), with a `.bam` file extension, in the output directory 

Redirect the stdout and stderr generated by your `samtools` command to an appropriately named log file.
The log file should be empty in this case.

<details>
  <summary><em><strong>Hint</strong> (click to reveal/hide)</em></summary><p>

  You'll need to include the following options in your command:
  `-b`, `-h`, `-f`, `-F`, `-q`, `-o`
</p></details>

  ```
  (samtools view -b -h -f 3 -F 12 -q 42 \
                 -o results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique.bam \
                 results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup.bam) \
  &> results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique_report.log
  ```
</p></details>

How many paired-end alignments remain after filtering?

```
samtools view results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique.bam \
              | cut -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

### Output:
```
537821
```

Next we'll apply the [`samtools sort`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-sort.html) command to sort alignments in the BAM file by their coordinates in the reference genome, such that alignments to the beginning of chromosome 1 will precede alignments to the end of chromosome 5.
Sorting alignments by their location in the reference genome is the default behaviour of this command, but other options can be specified to order alignments in different ways (e.g., by read name, with `-n`).
Different types of downstream analyses require differently sorted alignment files.
We are sorting by coordinates as this is necessary for subsequent identification of genetic variants between the genomes of two *A. thaliana* ecotypes.
We've actually already coordinate-sorted the alignments as part of the piped commands that removed duplicates, but it's a good idea to apply this coordinate-sorting step here just in case the duplicate-removal step of the pipeline has been skipped.

As is the case for `samtools view`, the `-o` part of this command is used to specify the output file.

```
(samtools sort -o results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique_sort.bam \
               results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique.bam) \
&> results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique_sort_report.log
```

The log file should be empty in this case as we are working with a small input BAM file.
With a larger input BAM file, the stdout from the `samtools sort` command would look something like:
 
```
[bam_sort_core] merging from 2 files...
```

* * *

## Step 5. Variant calling

Variant calling is the identification of genetic differences between a query sequence and a reference sequence, with reference sequence coordinates and allele information reported.
This process usually involves estimating variant frequency and removal of low-confidence potential variants.
The most abundant type of genetic variant is the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).

We will use [BCFtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bcftools.html) to identify sites in the reference genome that differ between L*er* and Col-0, based on the BAM file containing coordinate-sorted alignments of L*er* reads to the Col-0 reference genome.

For this, we need to index the FASTA-format reference genome using `samtools faidx`, which will generate `genome/TAIR10_chr_all.fa.fai` (although this file isn't explicitly included in the subsequent BCFtools commands).
As in previous steps, we should also make an output directory.

```
samtools faidx genome/TAIR10_chr_all.fa
mkdir results/bcftools/
```

### Step 5.1. Calculating read coverage

To enable variant calling, we also need to calculate read coverage throughout the reference genome using the [`bcftools mpileup`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bcftools.html#mpileup) command.
The `-O` option dictates the output file format, with `b` specifying a compressed BCF file, the binary counterpart to the [Variant Call Format (VCF)](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf).
The `-o` option is used to specify the output file itself, which should include a `.bcf` extension in this case.
Without this option specified, the output is written to stdout by default, rather than to a file. 
The `-f` option should be followed by the path to the reference genome in FASTA format (including the `.fa` extension), which must be indexed with `samtools faidx` before running `bcftools mpileup` (as above).

```
(bcftools mpileup -O b \
                  -o results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_raw.bcf \
                  -f genome/TAIR10_chr_all.fa \
                  results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique_sort.bam) \
&> results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_raw_report.log
```

### Step 5.2. Identifying potential variant sites

Now we can use [`bcftools call`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bcftools.html#call) to call SNPs and small insertions/deletions of sequence (indels) in the L*er* alignments relative to the Col-0 reference genome.
In the command below, `-O v` specifies that the output file type will be an uncompressed [VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf), and the path to the output file with a `.vcf` extension follows the `-o` option.
With `-m` specified, `bcftools call` uses a model for multiallelic and rare-variant calling. 
Inclusion of the `-v` option tells `bcftools call` to output variant sites only, rather than every genomic coordinate.

```
(bcftools call -O v -m -v \
               -o results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants.vcf \
               results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_raw.bcf) \
&> results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants_report.log
```

### Step 5.3. Filtering variants

To obtain a final set of high-confidence variant sites, we can use [`bcftools filter`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bcftools.html#filter) to remove those that do not meet certain criteria.
For this, we'll use the `-e` (short for `--exclude`) option to remove low-quality sites and sites where read depth is too low or too high (very high read depths can indicate PCR amplification or other artefacts, some of which may have already been removed by deduplicating reads or alignments).
Another option would be to use the `-e` option in conjunction with `-s LowQual` (short for `--soft-filter LowQual`) to *annotate* with the string "LowQual", rather than *exclude*, low-quality sites and sites where read depth is too low or too high.

The first two thresholds set in the example below are unrealistically low because we have been working with a very small sample of the reads in the original FASTQ files.
More appropriate filtering thresholds for a real analysis would be a minimum quality score (`QUAL`) of 20 and a minimum read depth (`DP`) of 10.

```
(bcftools filter -O v -e '%QUAL<5 || DP<2 || DP>100' \
                 -o results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants_filtered.vcf \
                 results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants.vcf) \
&> results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants_filtered_report.log
```

The inclusion of `%QUAL` in the filtering expression instructs `bcftools filter` to evaluate variant sites based on values in the QUAL column of the VCF.
The use of `||` to separate [filtering](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/filtering.html) criteria results in exclusion of variant sites where any one of those conditions is met in any of the samples analysed (although in this case we are analysing just one sample, from L*er* relative to the Col-0 reference genome).

Now have a look at the output [VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf) file containing filtered variant sites.

```
less -S results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants_filtered.vcf
```

All of the lines beginning with "##" contain meta-information, including a description of the file format, the version of BCFtools used, and the `bcftools` commands that you ran to generate this and intermediate files, along with information on abbreviations used in the VCF.

The line beginning with "#CHROM" is the header line, which contains column names.

The columns contain information about the the location and nature of the variant site:

| Column | Description |
|:--|:--| 
| CHROM | Name of reference sequence in which the variant site was called
| POS | 1-based position of the variant site in the reference sequence
| ID | `.` in the absence of unique identifiers
| REF | Reference allele at variant site
| ALT | Alternate (non-reference) allele(s) at variant site
| QUAL | Phred-scaled quality score for the called ALT allele
| FILTER | `.` when quality filters were not applied, `PASS` where filters were passed, or named filters the variant site failed
| INFO | Additional information, including read depth across all samples (DP) and alternate allele count (AC)

In this case, the final column ("results/[...]") provides the inferred genotype ("GT") of L*er* at the variant site, based on the likelihoods of the possible genotypes ("PL").
Genotypes are encoded as integers corresponding to REF and ALT alleles (e.g., for diploids, 0/1 indicates heterozygous with one REF allele and one ALT allele, 0/0 homozygous for the REF allele, 1/1 homozygous for an ALT allele, and 1/2 heterozygous with two ALT alleles).
The format of these metrics is specified in the penultimate column (e.g., "GT:PL").

The GATK Team wrote a useful [guide to the Variant Call Format](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531692-VCF-Variant-Call-Format).

We can use the `grep` and `wc` commands to count the number variant sites in the VCF file.

```
grep -v '#' results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants_filtered.vcf | wc -l
```

### Output:
```
62110
```

## Step 6. Visualising the alignments and variants

It's good practice to visualise aligned NGS reads in a [genome browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_browser), as this allows you to see how the data are distributed throughout a genome and in relation to annotated genomic features of interest, such as genes.
It can also reveal problems with the data, including regions with unduly low read coverage or alignment anomalies.
Exploring the data in this way can also motivate new questions about the underlying biology, thereby informing hypotheses that can be formally tested in subsequent analyses.

### Step 6.1. Using tview

A quick and basic way to visualise aligned reads is with [`samtools tview`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-tview.html).
For this to work, we need to index the BAM file containing the filtered and coordinate-sorted alignments using [`samtools index`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-index.html).

```
samtools index results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique_sort.bam
```

Have a look at the documentation available for `samtools tview` by running it without any options specified (this program doesn't have a `--help` option).

```
samtools tview
```

### Output:
```
Usage: samtools tview [options] <aln.bam> [ref.fasta]
Options:
   -d display      output as (H)tml or (C)urses or (T)ext 
   -X              include customized index file
   -p chr:pos      go directly to this position
   -s STR          display only reads from this sample or group
   -w INT          display width (with -d T only)
      --input-fmt-option OPT[=VAL]
               Specify a single input file format option in the form
               of OPTION or OPTION=VALUE
      --reference FILE
               Reference sequence FASTA FILE [null]
      --verbosity INT
               Set level of verbosity
```

View the alignments using `samtools tview`.

```
samtools tview results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique_sort.bam \
               genome/TAIR10_chr_all.fa
```

Then type `?` to see the options available for visualisation and navigation.
Type any key to exit the "Help" menu.
To navigate to position 127021 of chromosome 1, type `g` and in the dialogue box enter "1:127021" (without the speech marks).

### Output:
```
127021    127031    127041    127051    127061    127071    127081    127091    127101    127111    127121

                                            ............................C......................................
```

The first and second lines of the output denote the coordinates and sequence in the reference genome for Col-0.
The third line shows the consensus sequence based on the aligned L*er* reads shown beneath it.

On subsequent lines, reads aligning to the forward or reverse strand of the reference genome are indicated by strings of "." or "," characters, respectively, where the aligned sequence matches the reference sequence.
Sites where the aligned reads from L*er* contain base calls that differ from the reference sequence are indicated with the appropriate uppercase (forward strand) or lowercase (reverse strand) letter (e.g., "A", "C", "G", or "T"). A single "*" character denotes a single-base deletion in the aligned reads relative to the reference sequence, whereas a single gap in the reference sequence indicates a single-base insertion in the aligned reads relative to the reference. 

Consistent with the information in the filtered VCF file (`results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants_filtered.vcf`), 4 reads ("DP=4") covering position 127093 of chromosome 1 support the presence of a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in the form of a cytosine base in L*er*, whereas a thymine is present at this position of the reference genome for Col-0.
Only 1 read from L*er* indicates that a thymine is present at position 127023 of chromosome 1, while 2 reads from L*er* support the presence of a cytosine at this position, as is observed in the reference sequence.

Type `q` to exit `samtools tview`.

### Exercise 8 

You can also include in the `samtools tview` command a specific location to inspect, thereby bypassing the part involving the dialogue box in the example above.
Based on the usage example and options listed above, use [`samtools tview`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-tview.html) to visualise alignments to position 1232427 of chromosome 1 of the reference genome.

**Question:** Is the allelic variation you observe in the L*er* alignments relative to the Col-0 reference consistent with that detailed in the filtered VCF file?

  **Answer:** Consistent with the information in the filtered VCF file (`results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants_filtered.vcf`), 4 reads ("DP=4") covering position 1232427 of chromosome 1 support the presence of an adenine base in L*er*, whereas a cytosine is present at this position of the reference genome for Col-0.
  Additionally, 3 reads ("DP=3") covering position 1232441 of chromosome 1 indicate deletion of an adenine base in L*er* relative to the reference allele, as is reported in the VCF file.

### Step 6.2. Using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)

To visually explore the genomic locations of read alignments and variants in relation to annotated features of interest (e.g., genes, transposable elements, epigenetic marks), a more versatile and sophisticated genome browser is required.
A widely used example of this is the [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/):

> "The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance, easy-to-use, interactive tool for the visual exploration of genomic data. It supports flexible integration of all the common types of genomic data and metadata, investigator-generated or publicly available, loaded from local or cloud sources."  

As with the other tools we have used today, IGV is pre-installed on the Linux computers we are using.
But unlike the other tools, IGV has a graphical user interface (GUI).
Run `igv` at the command prompt to start it.

When it opens, click on the top-left drop-down menu and select the "A. thaliana (TAIR10)" reference genome.
You may need to select "More..." first to see available reference genomes other than "Human hg19".

To load the filtered read alignments in BAM format, navigate through the "File" menu to its location in the file system:

> File > Load from File... > Course_Materials/results/samtools/SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique_sort.bam  

Load the VCF file containing filtered variant sites in the same way:

> File > Load from File... > Course_Materials/results/bcftools/SRR3166543_top1M_variants_filtered.vcf  

At the top of the browser, there's a left–right scrollable, in–out zoomable rectangular panel showing coordinates in the reference genome sequence.
You can select individual sequences (e.g., chromosomes) within the reference sequence by clicking on their names within in the drop-down menu to the right of the genome selection drop-down menu at the top-left of the window.
Alternatively, you can specify a particular locus or range of coordinates by typing in the box to the right of these two drop-down menus (hover over the text-entry box to see examples of how loci can be specified here).
You can scroll left and right by clicking and dragging the cursor over the central part of the window.
You can zoom in and out using the "-" and "+" buttons (or the bars between them) at the top-right of the window.

Beneath the panel showing reference genomic coordinates, you should see four or five "tracks", depending on how far you have zoomed in:
1. The filtered variants in the VCF file, displayed as rectangles marking variant sites in the reference sequence. Right-click on the left-hand panel for this track (in which the VCF filename is displayed) and select "Color By > Allele Fraction" so that rectangles marking variants will be coloured according to the number of different alleles observed among the aligned reads. Beneath this, the track also shows colour-coded rectangles denoting the genotype of the sample at the variant site: cyan = homozygous; blue = heterozygous; filtered variant sites = transparent (the latter would be visible if we had annotated rather than removed variants based on our filtering criteria).  
2. Counts of aligned reads covering each genomic coordinate ("SRR3166543_top1M_MappedOn_TAIR10_chr_all_markdup_unique_sort.bam Coverage"). You may need to zoom in to see this and the subsequent track, either by clicking and dragging the cursor to cover the region of interest in the genomic coordinates panel, or using the zoom-in buttons at the top-right of the browser.
3. Aligned reads, with sequences matching the reference sequence shown in grey, and base calls that differ from the reference coloured differently according to the base called. Reads that aligned to the forward or reverse strand of the reference sequence are displayed with a pointed rightmost or leftmost edge, respectively.
4. The reference nucleotide sequence with 3-frame amino acid translations optionally displayed below. The reverse complement of the reference sequence can be displayed by clicking on the black arrow in the left-hand panel for this track.
5. Annotated genes in the *Arabidopsis thaliana* reference genome.

Move to different loci in the reference sequences and hover over variant sites and read alignments to see more information.
The Broad Institute provides more details on how [alignments](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/AlignmentData) and [variants](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/viewing_vcf_files) are visualised in IGV.

Many "tracks" corresponding to different samples and data types (e.g., wild type and mutant genotypes, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq read coverage, as well as loci indicative of epigenetic modifications) can be loaded and displayed together.
This provides a composite picture of the genetic, epigenetic and expression profiles of individual loci.
Genome browsers are therefore very useful for exploratory analyses.

Several web-based browsers are also available for different species with assembled genomes, such as those provided by [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html), [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/), [Phytozome](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/), and [The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)](https://www.arabidopsis.org/).

## Summary

We have used command-line tools to execute sequential data processing and analysis steps in a bioinformatics pipeline for variant calling.
Each step required input and output files that conform to standardised formats for storing genomics data.

Applying the steps outlined below, we identified DNA sequence differences (variants) in the genome of the L*er* ecotype of *A. thaliana* relative to the reference genome assembly for the Columbia (Col-0) ecotype:

1. Evaluation of sequencing read quality, including at the level of individual bases ([FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Removal of technical sequences (e.g., sequencing adapters) and low-quality bases ([Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))
3. Alignment of reads (from L*er*) to a reference genome (for Col-0) ([Bowtie 2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml))
4. Filtering of alignments based on the quality of these mappings to the reference genome ([SAMtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html))
5. Detection of DNA sequence differences between the L*er* and Col-0 genomes (variant calling) ([BCFtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bcftools.html))

* * *

### Exercise 9 (optional)

To make these steps run as part of an automated and reproducible bioinformatics pipeline, it's necessary to combine the commands into one script.
As bioinformatics pipelines tend to be applied to multiple samples, it would be useful to write this script such that the sample name is assigned to a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)).
In this way, each time the pipeline is run, a different sample name could be assigned to this variable.

If you have time, use a text editor to write a [bash script](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/writing-simple-bash-script/) named `variant_calling_pipeline.sh` that combines the commands we have run in each of the five steps of the pipeline.

<!--There are two text editors available in the virtual environment, the first of which is a lot more sophisticated:-->
